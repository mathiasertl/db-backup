dbclean is designed to cleanup regular database dumps and keep copies at a
certain granularity for a specified time. It is of course not restricted to
database dumps but can clean up any files that are saved at regular intervals.
This script was developed together with dbdump[1], hence its name. The defaults
are matched to those of dbdump, so they work together.

=== Installation ===
Simply check out the svn-repository:
        svn co http://svn.fsinf.at/mati/proj/pub/dbclean
If you don't want to specify the full path, you can of course copy dbclean.py
somewhere in your path (/usr/local/bin is usually good).

Note that this script *requires* python 3.0 or later.

=== Configuration ===
A sample configuration file is included with the source code, see:
